# cintel-02-data
Browser Interactive Data App &amp; Engage

Objectives


In this project, you'll implement a working interactive web app written in Python running in the browser that display data. We'll load the data into a DataFrame, and we'll create a sidebar for user inputs. We'll display data in a DataTable, Data Grid, and several charts. We'll work in the Shiny Playground in our browser (e.g. Chrome). We use GitHub to store our project code (we won't host a Pages app yet) - we'll use the Shiny Playground links and screenshots to share our work. We'll learn to connect the inputs to the outputs in the next module.
